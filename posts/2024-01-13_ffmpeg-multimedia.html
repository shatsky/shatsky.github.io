      <p>Useful FFmpeg commands, common formats reference</p>
<p>Practical tasks to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>downloading and lossless cutting of web videos</li>
<li>TODO creating &quot;video bookmarks&quot;, i. e. playable playlist-like files which refer to time interval in single video file and can be used to quickly create standalone video file for sharing; see VLC-specific M3U <code>#EXTVLCOPT:start-time</code>/<code>stop-time</code>, XSPF</li>
<li>TODO generic understanding of a/v sync in popular formats</li>
<li>TODO lossless transcoding of JPEG into more space efficient JPEG-XL</li>
</ul>
<h2>Useful FFmpeg commands</h2>
<p><strong>Download HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) videos</strong>: <code>ffmpeg -i &quot;${url_of_m3u8}&quot; -codec copy &quot;${output_filename}.mp4&quot;</code></p>
<p>You may remember &quot;good&quot; old times when web videos embedded in webpages were fetched by browser in single queries as &quot;normal&quot; video files. At the dawn of popularity of YouTube and other *Tubes and *Hubs, Adobe Flash Player based web video players were popular, which played FLV files, allowing to capture request URL via browser dev tools and download the file. Then circa 2007 HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag was introduced and in many cases it became possible to save video simply from context menu. However, for certain reasons, industry wanted technology which would allow streaming videos as sequences of short &quot;segment&quot; files, each fetched separately. Today, on many websites, even if you get to default context menu of &lt;video&gt; element and try to download, browser will, in best case, download only short fragment; in fact, there's no single video file being fetched, full or partial, during playback; what you will see in browser dev tools, depends. Some websites use proprietary solutions which require &quot;targeted&quot; solutions for video downloading (yt-dlp currently being the &quot;Swiss knife&quot; for these); most websites, however, adopted HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), introduced by Apple circa 2017. If you open browser dev tools on such website and start playback, you will see query to .m3u8 file and then many queries to .ts files. Well, .m3u8 is just M3U playlist in UTF-8, and .ts are &quot;MPEG Transport Stream segments&quot; listed in it, containing fragments of H.264 video stream and audio stream encoded with one of several supported codecs. FFmpeg allows to fetch the playlist with all segments listed in it and copy video and audio streams (without any lossy transcoding) to &quot;normal&quot; video file (MP4 being &quot;native&quot; container for H.264) in one command.</p>
<p>Note: some recommend adding <code>-bsf:a aac_adtstoasc</code> to convert <a href="https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/ADTS">ADTS</a> to <a href="https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/MPEG-4_Audio#Audio_Specific_Config">ASC</a> (audio stream metadata), but https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-bitstream-filters.html#aac_005fadtstoasc states it's auto-inserted for MP4.</p>
<p>Note: this is only applicable for DRM-free videos.</p>
<p><strong>Cut videos at defined time interval</strong>: <code>ffmpeg -ss ${hh_start}:${mm_start}:${ss_start} -to ${hh_end}:${mm_end}:${ss_end} -i &quot;${input_file}&quot; -c copy &quot;${output_file}&quot;</code></p>
<p>Note: most frames in video streams are stored as &quot;deltas&quot;, and only some are full &quot;keyframes&quot;; video has to start with &quot;keyframe&quot;, and cutting time_start will likely not match one, so preceding frames starting with previous keyframe will be copied too; audio stream doesn't have something like &quot;keyframes&quot; synchronized with video ones; therefore, upon copying from MP4 to MP4, ffmpeg can create file with video or audio starting not exactly from 0s, causing minor playback issues in some players. Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>ffplay (FFmpeg reference player impl) starts playback from ~time_start moment, both video and audio</li>
<li>Firefox plays some frames of video preceding ~time_start without sound, sound starts at ~time_start</li>
<li>mpv (based on FFmpeg) also plays some frames of video preceding ~time_start without sound, but after the sound starts it increases video playback speed for a moment, emitting stderr warning about a/v sync issue, then playback proceeds normally</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding <code>-avoid_negative_ts make_zero</code></li>
<li>using MKV target container</li>
<li>somehow explicitly cutting on keyframes</li>
</ul>
<p>All these solutions seem to result in creation of file which has both video and audio starting from preceding keyframe (synchronized, of course)</p>
<p><strong>Encode video to H.264</strong>: <code>ffmpeg -i &quot;${input_file}&quot; -c:v libx264 &quot;${output_file}&quot;</code></p>
<p>If output_file is *.mp4, ffmpeg picks H.264 by default</p>
<p><strong>Cut videos at defined time interval and render subtitles into video</strong>: <code>ffmpeg -ss ${hh_start}:${mm_start}:${ss_start} -copyts -to ${hh_end}:${mm_end}:${ss_end} -i &quot;${input_file}&quot; -ss ${hh_start}:${mm_start}:${ss_start} -vf subtitles=&quot;${input_file_containing_subtitles}:si={subtitles_track_index}&quot; &quot;${output_file}&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>${input_file_containing_subtitles}</code> is required even if subtitle tracks are contained in input video file, i. e. if duplicating <code>${input_file}</code></p>
<p><code>:si={subtitles_track_index}</code> is only required if there are multiple subtitle tracks and needed track is not the 1st</p>
<p><code>-copyts</code> and 2nd <code>-ss</code> are required</p>
<h3>Reference of used FFmpeg cmdline options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>-codec copy</code>: copy streams without re-encoding, i. e. without added loss of quality</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formats</h2>
<p>&quot;Video format&quot; is usually combination of</p>
<ul>
<li>video stream (codec) format</li>
<li>audio stream (codec) format</li>
<li>some metadata format(s)</li>
<li>container (muxer) format, multiplexing all above so that they can be played synchronously; some container formats are developed to contain only specific stream formats, others are more generic</li>
</ul>
<p>Development of all these seems to be mostly driven by development of video formats (obviously being the most complex part of the stack)</p>
<h3>Web video file formats</h3>
<p>To put simply:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Origins</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MP4</td>
<td>MP4 container containing H.264/H.265 video stream</td>
<td>Initially supported in major proprietary browsers developed by commercial companies since HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag was introduced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ogg</td>
<td>Ogg container containing Theora video stream</td>
<td>Alternative pushed by FOSS community because MP4/H.264 standards are not truly free, making them problematic to implement for non-commercial developers and just incompatible with FOSS philosophy; practically obsoleted by WebM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WebM</td>
<td>MKV container containing VP8/VP9 video stream</td>
<td>Alternative pushed by Google because commercial companies opposed to implementing Ogg/Theora; Google just bought On2, company which had developed Theora, originally known as VP3, made all its then-latest competitive VP8 codec public domain too, and continued developing it; MKV container chosen for multiplexing had been open standard from the beginning</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Full reality is more complicated, for each format there are more codecs (which are extremely rarely used), but at the same time some major browsers don't support even some of those mentioned (or did in the past but have dropped support). HTML5 itself doesn't actually define required formats which should be supported for &lt;video&gt; (but allows to provide several different files)</p>
<h3>Video codecs</h3>

<td>Google</td>
<td>2012</td>
<td>Subsequent development of VP8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Theora</td>
<td>VP3</td>
<td>On2 -&gt; Xiph.org</td>
<td>2004</td>
<td>To be precise, VP3 and Theora are not same thing; On2 had released VP3 into public domain, and Xiph.org &quot;improved&quot; it, creating &quot;superset&quot; codec (Theora implementations can decode VP3 streams, but original VP3 can't decode Theora streams)</td>
